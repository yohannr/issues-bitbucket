# Issues-Bitbucket

Simple tool which extract open/new issues from Bitbucket.

## TODO

- manage french/english (regarding browser)
- graphic interface with table and why not a way to send the report by mail or send a mail for a dedicated issue
- order by priority (critical, major, minor, trivial), type (bug, enhancement, task, proposal) and add color
